    <div class="content-text"> 
        🕰️ Back in the day — let’s say 1000 years ago... <br>
        A king  👑 (let's keep him unnamed) and he wants to send a <strong>secret msg</strong> 📜 to someone important , and 
        because he is a king he would never send his secret msg with anyone he just found in front of him.<br>
        Yup, The King did it ... or let's say if he want. <br>
        <br>
        👑 <strong>king</strong>: Hey, commoner . <br>
        🧍‍♂️ <strong>Commoner</strong> : Yes , King ? <br>
        👑 <strong>king</strong>: that's a secret msg and I want you to take it to Dr.alva <br>
        🧍‍♂️ <strong>Commoner</strong>: ...Okay. (Who is Dr. Alva anyway? 😅) <br>
        <br>
        At this moment, we can notice <strong>three serious problems</strong> ⚠️: <br>
        <br>
        1️⃣ <strong>Trust</strong> 🕵️‍♂️ <br>
        The king doesn't trust the commoner. meaning the Commoner isn't a trusted source. <br>
        👉 He might <strong>read the msg</strong> before it reaches its destination. <br>
        <br>
        2️⃣ <strong>Protection</strong> 🛡️ <br>
        The Commoner has <strong>no means and no power</strong> to defend the msg. <br>
        👉 He can find or <strong>attacked by thieves</strong> in his way (msg gone). <br>
        <br> 
        3️⃣ <strong>Loyalty</strong> 🤷‍♂️ <br>
        The Commoner might not be <strong>loyal</strong> to the king , <br>
        👉 he could simply <strong>run away</strong> with the msg without delivering it.<br>

        The king 👑 knows all these problems because he is a king with basic 
        knowledge of <strong>information security</strong> 🔐 . <br>
        he sends his secret msg with a group that he trusts. He plans for their <strong>departure time</strong>,
        chooses the <strong>safest route</strong>, and of course He <strong>encrypts</strong> 🔐 the
         msg using (really basic ) cipher. <br>
        right now the king is resting in his room <strong>(enjoying some bananas 🍌)</strong> feeling 90%
         sure the group will return safely.  <br>
        Why ? because they don't have the same weaknesses the commoner had . <br>
        <strong>Trust ?</strong> They have it ✅ , <strong>Power ?</strong> They are 
        armored group 💪, <strong>Loyalty ?</strong> Absolutely 🫡. <br>

        And that's exactly what Cyber Security / Information Security  is all about 🎯 . <br>
        We use <strong>internet</strong> 🌐 every single moment , sending thousands of digital messages 
        [named <strong>packets</strong> 📦 in Networking] from you (<strong>client</strong>👤) to website
         (<strong>Server</strong> 🖥️). <br>

        If we don’t protect those packets: <br>
        ❌ <strong>Hackers</strong> 🕵️‍♂️🧨 might intercept them, read them, or even stop them from 
        reaching their destination. <br>
        <br>
        Cybersecurity is how we: <br>
        🔐 Encrypt messages <br>
        ✅ Control who can access data <br>
        🛡️ Defend systems from attacks <br>
        <br>
        💡 Just remember:  <br>
        🔐 Information Security = Protecting any kind of data (paper, files, USBs...) <br>
        💻 Cybersecurity = Focused on protecting digital data — like your packets, emails, and passwords. <br>
