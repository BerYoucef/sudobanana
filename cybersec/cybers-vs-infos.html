        people always ask what's the difference between Cyber sec and information sec . <br>
        I'll explain it to you in depth with visuals and examples, You'll never ask this question again .<br>
    </div>
    <h2 class="section-header" >📁 Information Security: </h2>
    <div class="content-text" >
        information security is the way that we protect any kind of data [papers, secret government files, digital data
        USBs, Hard Drive ...etc ]  ,anything that contains an information .<br>
    </div>
    <h3 class="section-header" style="text-decoration: none;" >How we protect this informations ?</h3>
    <div class="content-text">
        Well ther are multiple techniques to reach that goal , and here are some of it : <br> <br>  
        🔒 <strong>Physical locks</strong> : <br>
        ~ A CEO of a company use a physical lock to protect Drawers containing sensitive documents.<br>
        or even you are using it in order to protect your house when you outside .<br>
        
        🪪 <strong>Access Badges</strong> :<br>
        ~ most companies , hotels or even you are using it in order to reject unauthorized peoples to enter certen sensitive 
        places  (like your room ? ) . <br>
        
        📋 <strong>Document Classification</strong> :<br>
        ~ companies use this to classify their documents like: secret , too secret , public ...etc <br>
        maybe you ask what's the goal of this classification ? simply because if they don't do that , they can't use 
        an authentication system ,and anyone can see any document they want at any time, 
        or maybe to store it in different places based on the <strong>Classification</strong>, <br>
        for example :<br>
        ~ Imagine a <strong>Top Secret document</strong> will be stored at a employee office (That's a Disaster!!!). <br>
        but the question is <strong>Can you check your goverments docs ?"</strong>"<br> 
        Thats why we use classification. <br>
        <div class="code-block"> 
            <img src="https://github.com/BerYoucef/sudobanana/imgs/Data_Classification.png" alt="Data_Classification.png">
        </div> <br>
    
        🧾 <strong>Paper Shredding</strong> : <br>
        ~ this technique is used when we dont need some kind of documents anymore , but this documents is still important ,
        maybe they contain phone numbers , photos ...etc. thats a short example :
        Let's say there are a sick person taking medicine in the hospital , and today finally he will get out of the hospital,
        his medical document is now not important to the hospital and they will not use it anymore, they'll not trash it.
        because anyone can read this document and find some good info like (person name , phone number , photo, 
        DNA , fingerprint ...etc), the hospital will put all of this documents in a secret place , until
        A specialized security company comes in and took all of this docs and Cut ✂️ the docs into very small pieces
        until they ensure that the paper docs in non-recyclabe . <br>
        and with that we protect the patient informations from theft . <br>

        🔥 FireWalls: <br>
        ~ To protects Servers from external attacks. <br>

        👁️‍🗨️ Surveillance : <br>
        ~ this is simple , we just use cameras in storage places or any kind of sensitive place .<br>

        🖊️ Sign-in/Sign-out Logs :<br>
        ~ the goal is to monitor who took or viewed docs and when .<br>

        🧯 Environmental Security:<br>
        ~ Such as : fire systems , humidity, to protect paper files from damage .<br>

        Well, There are another techniques you can search, here are some :  <br>
        [secure storage, Security Guards, Non-Disclosure-Agrements,Cear Desk Policy, Role-Based Access, 
        Time-Restricted Access, Locked Containers, Faraday Cages, Secure Communication Rooms, No Mobile Policy ...etc  ] <br>

        I think your brain is starting to put the pieces together! 🧩🧠 <br>

    <h2 class="section-header">🖥️ Cyber Security:</h2>
    <div class="content-text">
        Now let's move to Cyber Security. As you read above , I have mentioned that the Information Security protect 
        even Digital DATA , When we are specifically protecting digital information, we use Cybersecurity,
        which is a subset of Information Security. Simple right ? <br>
        Here are some (Cybersec is bigger than I just say "some" 😅) techniques that used in cyber security : 
        Encryptions.<br>
        Access Control.<br>
        System defence Techniques like Firewalls. <br>
        <br>
        ~ I didn't explain much about the Cyber Security Techniques... But you can find everything you need at Cyber Security

    ~ Think of Information Security as the umbrella ☂️, and Cybersecurity as one of its ribs — the digital one 💻. <br>
