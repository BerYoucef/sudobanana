    <div class="content-text">You’ve met the wiki. Now meet the weirdo who built it. 👨‍💻🍌</div>
    <h2 class="section-header" >Who am I?👋</h2>
    <div class="content-text">
        My name is Youcef.B ~ well, that’s not the important part. What is important is this: <br>
        I’m just a curious human who got obsessed with cybersecurity 🔐 <br>
        Not because it’s cool (even though it is 😎), but because it makes my brain feel alive. <br>
        I’ve always wanted to understand: <br>
        <strong>~</strong>How systems break 🧠<br>
        <strong>~</strong>Why they break 💥<br>  
        <strong>~</strong>And how attackers think 🕵️‍♂️<br>
        This wiki — SudoBanana — is where I document that journey. <br>
        It started with scribbled notes and random docs lost in my room… <br>
        and turned into a place I actually wanted to visit again.<br>
        A place that feels fun, not forced. <br></div>

    <h2 class="section-header">💭 Why I made this wiki</h2>
    <div class="content-text">
        I noticed something: <br>
        When I write on paper, I forget it. <br>
        When I explain it like a story — with colors, jokes, analogies — <br>
        I remember. And I enjoy it. So I decided: <br>
        Why not create a space where I can learn, document, and laugh — all at once?          <br>  
        A place where: <br>
        💡 You learn about RCE while smiling.           <br>
        🍌 You explore the logic behind the bug—not just the syntax of the exploit.     <br>       
        🧠 You explore a topic not because you have to... but because you want to...<br>
        This wiki is as much for me as it is for you 👍.  <br>     </div> 

    <h2 class="section-header">🎯 My Goal</h2>
    <div class="content-text">
        To become a world-class cybersecurity expert. 👊 <br>
        To think like an attacker, build like an engineer, and teach like a friend.<br>
        But I’m not rushing. I’m documenting the process.<br>
        Every tool I learn. Every vulnerability. Every silly idea.<br>
        All here.<br>
        All open.<br>
        All… banana-flavored.<br>
    </div>

    <h2 class="section-header">🚀 The Dream?</h2>
    <div class="content-text">
        I don’t want this to be just a wiki. I want SudoBanana to become:<br>
        <strong>~</strong>A community 🍌. <br>
        <strong>~</strong>A reference point 🔎.  <br>
        <strong>~</strong>A movement for fun × deep learning. <br>
        
        ...Built slowly, with intention. (Not because I'm lazy — I swear.)  <br>
        Shaped by learning, not noise.  <br>
        Guided by clarity, not <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Some programmers don’t sleep — they respawn with a cup of coffe at 3AM 😂😂.">caffeine overdoses.</span> ☕🚫  <br>
        And if things break sometimes... that’s probably part of the plan. Probably. <br>
        
        It starts here.  <br>
        And if you're reading this — well, congrats.  <br>
        You’ve officially joined the Banana Cult™.<br>
